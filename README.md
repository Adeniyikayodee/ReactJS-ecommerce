# E-Commerce

I only built this to examine my knowledge of ReactJS. Used CommerceJS API for backend. Didn't intergate payment.


$ Git Clone \\

$ npm install react-script --save \\

$ register on commerceJS, upload products and copy API key \\

$ fix your URL KEYS in .env (sample availiable in ENV.SAM) \\

$ npm start (localhost 3000) \\

$ npm run build to host \\


GOODLUCK!
